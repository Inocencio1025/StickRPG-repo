StickRPG-repo
Game in Unity

This is a personal project that I created for the purpose of learning and self growth, 
and exposing myself to common coding practices shared by software developers. 
It is a basic top-down 2D pixel art game written in C# with turn-based combat inspired by games 
such as those earlier in the Final Fantasy series. The goal of this project is not to do anything new or innovative, 
but to sharpen my coding skills with practice and have fun doing so.
